\chapter{Appendix 2: Categorization of PlacesNet labels}
\label{chap:app2}
As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:generation} I classified the labels from Placesnet, a deep learning framework to recognize the types of outdoor places~\cite{zhou2014learning}, into 4 distinct categories namely Architectural, Natural, Landmarks and Walkable. These categories were picked up to understand the effect of 4 broad classes of built and natural entities on urban beauty. The definitions for the category descriptions were defined based on the guidelines from ~\cite{ewing2013measuring}.

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Walkable} A scene from PlacesNet was defined to be walkable, if the scene is perceived to facilitate people to walk.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Landmarks} A scene from PlacesNet was defined to be a Landmark, if the scene can be used to articulate, remember or communicate location relative to an object.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Architectural} A scene from PlacesNet was defined to be Architectural, if the scene can be described to be a part of the city's built environment.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Natural} A scene from PlacesNet was defined to be Natural, if the scene evokes the feeling about being in proximity with nature.
\end{definition}

Once the labels were classified, I developed metrics around the built environment of a place, based on the frequencies of labels belonging to the four categories. 
A detailed categorization of the scene labels into the four categories can be found in Table~\ref{tab:PlacesLabels}.
